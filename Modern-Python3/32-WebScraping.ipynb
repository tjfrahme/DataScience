Here at Rithm School we used to teach MongoDB in conjunction with Node.js. Recently, however, we have switched our Node.js curriculum to utilize PostgreSQL. For a taste of what that looks like, check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/different-approaches-express\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joel&#39;s blog post</a> or our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/node-express-fundamentals/introduction-to-postgres-with-node\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free online curriculum</a> on relational databases with Node/Express.</p>\n",

      "<p>Much of the reason for this curriculum change is that relational databases, the SQL language, and ORMs can take a long time to master and are more widely-used across the industry. We decided therefore it would be best if our students could focus on mastering SQL and relational databases (the dominant database tech for the last 40 years) rather than split that time between a completely different technology that has only recently risen in popularity.</p>\n",

      "<p>But another significant reason that I would like to argue is: MongoDB really isn&#39;t that hard to learn and master! If you&#39;re comfortable with JavaScript, JSON, and Node.js/Express.js (which all of our graduates are), then teaching yourself MongoDB can be a cakewalk.

      "        <p>Until recently, many people thought the sole source of success boiled down to their intelligence (IQ). However, research has been emerging since the late 90’s that there is a definitive link between career success and <em>emotional</em> intelligence (EQ). Intelligence is your ability to learn, which remains the same whether you’re 15 or 50 years old. EQ is not a steadfast metric, it’s a flexible set of skills that can be learned and improved with practice. You may be saying to yourself “but my technical skills will speak for themselves - why should I care about this?”</p>\n",

      "<p>Much of the reason for this curriculum change is that relational databases, the SQL language, and ORMs can take a long time to master and are more widely-used across the industry. We decided therefore it would be best if our students could focus on mastering SQL and relational databases (the dominant database tech for the last 40 years) rather than split that time between a completely different technology that has only recently risen in popularity.</p>\n",
      "<p>But another significant reason that I would like to argue is: MongoDB really isn't that hard to learn and master! If you're comfortable with JavaScript, JSON, and Node.js/Express.js (which all of our graduates are), then teaching yourself MongoDB can be a cakewalk.

And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?
